# User Guide for Key Generator Tool (`keygenerator.py`)

## Overview
The keygenerator.py script generates cryptographic keys for symmetric and asymmetric encryption.
Users can generate keys and save them to files for later use in encryption and decryption operations.

## Usage
python keygenerator.py [sym|asym] [filename to store key in]

#### Key Types
- sym: Generate a symmetric key (stored with a .key extension).
- asym: Generate an asymmetric key pair (private key stored with a .pem extension, public key stored with a .pub extension).

#### Examples
- Generate a Symmetric Key:
	- python keygenerator.py sym my_symmetric_key.key
This command creates a symmetric key and saves it to my_symmetric_key.key.

- Generate an Asymmetric Key Pair:
	python keygenerator.py asym my_asymmetric_key
	This command creates an asymmetric key pair, saving the private key as my_asymmetric_key.pem and the public key as my_asymmetric_key.pub.
